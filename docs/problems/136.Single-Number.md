# 136 Single Number

## Description

[Problem: 136 Single Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number)

The problem requires finding the single number in an array where every element appears twice, except for one. The task is to identify that single number.

For example:

- **Input:** nums = \[2, 2, 1\]
- **Output:** 1

In this case, the number 1 is the only number that appears once, while the number 2 appears twice.

The problem requires linear and constant space.

## Brute Force

We can first sort the `nums` array and then compare adjacent elements.

### Code

```python
def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    nums.sort()
    n = len(nums)
    i = 0
    while i < n - 1:
        if nums[i] == nums[i + 1]:
              i += 2
        else:
            return nums[i]
    return nums[n - 1]
```

### Time Complexity

- Time Complexity: O(nlogn) because of sort
- Space Complexity: O(1)

## Optimal Solution

The above solution requires `nlogn` running time.
If we use a hash to count how many times each element appears, it will also require `n` space.

How can we solve this problem in linear time and constant space?

Answer: XOR operator

- Fact 1: a ^ 0 = a
- Fact 2: a ^ a = 0

If we XOR all the elements, the result will be the unique element.

### Code

```python
def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    result = 0
    for n in nums:
        result ^= n
    return result
```

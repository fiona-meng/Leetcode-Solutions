# 1614 Maximum Nesting Depth of the Parentheses

## Description

Given a valid parentheses string s, return the nesting depth of s. The nesting depth is the maximum number of nested parentheses.

Example 1:

Input: s = "(1+(2\*3)+((8)/4))+1"

Output: 3

Explanation:

Digit 8 is inside of 3 nested parentheses in the string.

Example 2:

Input: s = "(1)+((2))+(((3)))"

Output: 3

Explanation:

Digit 3 is inside of 3 nested parentheses in the string.

Example 3:

Input: s = "()(())((()()))"

Output: 3

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 100
s consists of digits 0-9 and characters '+', '-', '\*', '/', '(', and ')'.
It is guaranteed that parentheses expression s is a VPS.

## Approach:

When we encounter a `(`, we increase a counter by 1 to represent an increase in nesting depth. Conversely, when we encounter a `)`, we decrease the counter by 1, indicating the end of a nesting level. Throughout the iteration, we continuously update and keep track of the maximum value of this counter, which represents the maximum nesting depth of the parentheses.

```python
def maxDepth(self, s: str) -> int:
  s = list(s)
  k = 0
  result = 0
  for i in s:
      if i == '(':
          k += 1
      elif i == ')':
          k -= 1
      result = max(result, k)
  return result
```

Complexity:

- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

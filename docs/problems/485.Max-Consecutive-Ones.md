# 485 Max Consecutive Ones

## Description

[Problem: 485 Max Consecutive Ones](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones)

Given a binary array `nums`, return the maximum number of consecutive `1`'s in the array.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s. The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 2

Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `nums[i]` is either `0` or `1`

## Code

```python
def findMaxConsecutiveOnes(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    result = 0
    curr = 0
    for n in nums:
        if n == 1:
            curr += 1
        else:
            curr = 0
        result = max(result, curr)
    return result
```

# 229 Majority Element II

## Description

Given an integer array of size n, find all elements that appear more than ⌊ n/3 ⌋ times.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: [3]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1]
Output: [1]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,2]
Output: [1,2]

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 5 \* 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109

## Approach 1: Brute Force

Use a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of each element in the array.
After populating the dictionary, iterate through it to find and collect all elements that appear more than ⌊ n/3 ⌋ times.

```python
def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    count = {}
    res = []
    for n in nums:
        if n not in count:
            count[n] = 0
        count[n] += 1

    for key, c in count.items():
        if c > len(nums) // 3:
            res.append(key)
    return res
```

## Approach 2: Moore Voting Algorithm

To solve this problem, we need to identify elements that appear more than ⌊ n/3 ⌋ times in the array. Since an element must appear more than ⌊ n/3 ⌋ times to be considered, there can be at most two such elements in the array.

Consider a scenario where we have three distinct elements, each appearing exactly `n // 3` times. In this case, none of them would qualify as appearing more than ⌊ n/3 ⌋ times.

To implement this approach, we maintain two potential candidates and their respective counts. Here's how it works:

1. Initialize two candidate variables and their counts to zero.
2. Iterate through the array:
   - If the current element matches one of the candidates, increment the corresponding count.
   - If the current element does not match either candidate and one of the counts is zero, set the current element as the new candidate and reset its count to one.
   - If the current element does not match either candidate and both counts are non-zero, decrement both counts.
3. After processing the array, verify the counts of the two candidates to ensure they appear more than ⌊ n/3 ⌋ times.

This method efficiently narrows down the potential majority elements and verifies their counts in a second pass through the array.

```python
def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    candidate1, candidate2 = None, None
    count1, count2 = 0, 0
    for n in nums:
        if n == candidate1:
            count1 += 1
        elif n == candidate2:
            count2 += 1

        elif count1 == 0:
            candidate1 = n
            count1 = 1
        elif count2 == 0:
            candidate2 = n
            count2 = 1
        else:
            count1 -= 1
            count2 -= 1
    n1 = nums.count(candidate1)
    n2 = nums.count(candidate2)
    res = []
    if n1 > len(nums) // 3:
        res.append(candidate1)
    if n2 > len(nums) // 3:
        res.append(candidate2)
    return res
```

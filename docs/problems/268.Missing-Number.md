# 268 Missing Number

## Description

[Problem: 268 Missing Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number)

The problem asks you to find a missing element from a given list of integers, ranging from 0 to \( n \). The list is of length \( n \) and contains \( n \) unique numbers, meaning that exactly one number from the complete range of 0 to \( n \) is missing. Your task is to determine which number is absent.

For example:

- **Input:** nums = \[3, 0, 1\]
- **Output:** 2

In this case, the numbers range from 0 to 3 (inclusive), and the number 2 is missing from the input array.

## Brute Force

We can initialize an array to keep track of which elements have already appeared.

1. **Step 1:** Initialize an array and set all elements to -1 (this is safe since elements range from 0 to \( n \)). The length of the array should be \( n + 1 \).

   - Example: `arr = [-1, -1, -1, -1]`

2. **Step 2:** Loop over the `nums`. If an element appears in `nums`, update it in the array.
   - Example: The first element of `nums` is 3. Update `arr` to `[-1, -1, -1, 3]`.

By the end of the loop, you should get `arr = [0, 1, -1, 3]`. Since -1 appears at index 2, we know that element 2 is missing.

### Code

```python
def missingNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    n = len(nums)
    arr = [-1] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        arr[nums[i]] = nums[i]
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if arr[i] == -1:
            return i
```

### Time Complexity

- Time Complexity: \( O(n) \)
- Space Complexity: \( O(n) \)

## Optimal Solution 1 - In-place Cyclic Sort

### Intuition

The above solution requires \( O(n) \) space. We can improve this by using only \( O(1) \) space by marking elements in place. The idea is to place each number at its correct index, i.e., if `nums[i] = x`, then ideally `nums[x] = x`. After this rearrangement:

- If we find `nums[i] != i`, then \( i \) is our missing number.
- If all numbers match their indices, then \( n \) must be the missing number (since we only have indices 0 to \( n-1 \)).

### Algorithm Steps

- Loop over `nums`. If `nums[i] != i`, swap `nums[i]` with `nums[nums[i]]`.
- After arrangement, loop over `nums` again: If `nums[i] != i`, return \( i \); otherwise, return \( n \).

**Be careful**: What swap version is correct? (Pause and think for a moment)

- **Version A:** `nums[i], nums[nums[i]] = nums[nums[i]], nums[i]`
- **Version B:** `nums[nums[i]], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[nums[i]]`

Version B is correct! Why? If we update `nums[i]` first as in Version A, then use `nums[i]` again (in `nums[nums[i]]`), it now points to the wrong index.

### Code

```python
def missingNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    n = len(nums)
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if nums[i] < n and nums[i] != i:
            nums[nums[i]], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[nums[i]]
        else:
            i += 1
    for i in range(n):
        if i != nums[i]:
            return i
    return n
```

### Time Complexity

- Time Complexity: \( O(n) \)
- Space Complexity: \( O(1) \)

## Optimal Solution 2 - Sum of All Elements

### Intuition

The idea is simple: if we have all numbers from 0 to \( n \), their sum should be \( n \times (n+1)/2 \) (arithmetic sequence). If one number is missing, the difference between this expected sum and the actual sum of array elements must be our missing number.

For example:

- If \( n=3 \), the array should contain \[0, 1, 2, 3\], sum = 6
- If the actual array is \[3, 0, 1\], sum = 4
- Missing number = 6 - 4 = 2

### Code

```python
def missingNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    n = len(nums)
    expected = n * (n + 1) // 2
    actual = sum(nums)
    return expected - actual
```

### Time Complexity

- Time Complexity: \( O(n) \)
- Space Complexity: \( O(1) \)

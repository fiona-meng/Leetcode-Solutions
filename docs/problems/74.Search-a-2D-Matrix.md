# 74 Search a 2D Matrix

## Description

You are given an m x n integer matrix matrix with the following two properties:

Each row is sorted in non-decreasing order.
The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.
Given an integer target, return true if target is in matrix or false otherwise.

You must write a solution in O(log(m \* n)) time complexity.

Example 1:

Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 3
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 13
Output: false

Constraints:

m == matrix.length
n == matrix[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 100
-104 <= matrix[i][j], target <= 104

## Approach: Binary Search

Consider `m` as the number of rows in the matrix and `n` as the number of columns.

The matrix can be viewed as a single sorted list with `m * n` elements.

To perform binary search, initialize `left` to `0` and `right` to `m * n - 1`.

To find the middle element, calculate its position in the matrix using:

- `mid_row = mid // n` to determine the row index.
- `mid_column = mid % n` to determine the column index.

```python
def searchMatrix(self, matrix: List[List[int]], target: int) -> bool:
    m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
    left, right = 0, m * n - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        row = mid // n
        column = mid % n
        if matrix[row][column] == target:
            return True
        elif matrix[row][column] > target:
            right = mid - 1
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    return False
```

## Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: `O(log(n * m))`
- Space Complexity: `O(1)`

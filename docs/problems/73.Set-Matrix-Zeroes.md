# 73 Set Matrix Zeroes

[Problem 73: Set Matrix Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/set-matrix-zeroes)

Given an m x n integer matrix matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0's.

You must do it in place.

Example 1:

Input: matrix = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]
Output: [[1,0,1],[0,0,0],[1,0,1]]
Example 2:

Input: matrix = [[0,1,2,0],[3,4,5,2],[1,3,1,5]]
Output: [[0,0,0,0],[0,4,5,0],[0,3,1,0]]

Constraints:

m == matrix.length
n == matrix[0].length
1 <= m, n <= 200
-231 <= matrix[i][j] <= 231 - 1

Follow up:

A straightforward solution using O(mn) space is probably a bad idea.
A simple improvement uses O(m + n) space, but still not the best solution.
Could you devise a constant space solution?

## Approach 1: Using Constant Space

Step 1: Traverse the matrix to identify all rows and columns that contain at least one zero. Store the indices of these rows and columns in two separate sets, `row` and `col`.

Step 2: Iterate over the matrix again, setting the entire row and column to zero for each index found in the `row` and `col` sets.

```python
def setZeroes(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> None:
    """
    Do not return anything, modify matrix in-place instead.
    """
    col = set()
    row = set()
    n, m = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            curr = matrix[i][j]
            if curr == 0:
                row.add(i)
                col.add(j)
    for e in row:
        matrix[e] = [0] * m
    for e in col:
        for i in range(n):
            matrix[i][e] = 0
```

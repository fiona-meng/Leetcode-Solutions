# 56 Merge Intervals

## Description

Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

Example 1:

Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].
Example 2:

Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.

Constraints:

1 <= intervals.length <= 104
intervals[i].length == 2
0 <= starti <= endi <= 104

## Approach:

Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to keep track of the current interval's boundaries.
Initially, set them to `None`. As you iterate through the sorted intervals, update these pointers:

- If `left` and `right` are `None`, assign them the values of the current interval's start and end.
- If the current interval's start is less than or equal to the `right` boundary, it indicates an overlap. In this case, extend the `right` boundary to the maximum of the current `right` and the current interval's end.
- If there is no overlap, append the current interval `[left, right]` to the result list, and update `left` and `right` to the current interval's start and end.

```python
def merge(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    intervals.sort()
    left, right = None, None
    result = []
    for i in intervals:

        curr_left, curr_right = i[0], i[1]
        if left is None:
            left = curr_left
            right = curr_right
        elif right >= curr_left:
            right = max(right, curr_right)
        else:
            result.append([left, right])
            left, right = curr_left, curr_right
    result.append([left, right])
    return result
```

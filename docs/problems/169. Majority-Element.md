# 169 Majority Element

## Description

Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2

Constraints:

n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 5 \* 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109

Follow-up: Could you solve the problem in linear time and in O(1) space?

## Approach 1: Sorting

### Intution

Since the majority element will appear more than `⌊n / 2⌋` times, it will always occupy the middle position when the array is sorted. Therefore, we can sort the array and return the element at index n/2.

```python
def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
  nums.sort()
  n = len(nums)
  return nums[n // 2]
```

### Complecity Analysis

- Time Complexity: `O(nlogn)` since sorting requires `nlogn`
- Space Complecity: `O(1)`

## Approch 2: Hashing

### Intution

We can simply count appearance for each elements. If the element appear more than `⌊n / 2⌋` times, then it will be majority element.

```python
def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    dic = {}
    for n in nums:
        if n not in dic:
            dic[n] = 0
        dic[n] += 1
    n = len(nums) / 2
    for key, value in dic.items():
        if value > n:
            return key
```

### Complexity Analysis

-Time Complexity: `O(n)`
-Space Complexity: `O(n)`

## Approach: Moore Voting Algorithm

### How it works:

- Initalization: initalize two varibles: candidate and count
  candidate can be arbitary number and count set to `0`

- Iteration:
  If `count == 0`, set current number as candidate and increment count by 1

If `current element == candidate`, then increment count by 1

If `current element != candidate`, then decrement count by 1

- Result:
  Return the candidate as result. The candidate is the majority element.

```python
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        count = 0
        candidate = float('inf')
        for n in nums:
            if count == 0:
                candidate = n
            if n == candidate:
                count += 1
            elif n != candidate:
                count -= 1
        return candidate
```

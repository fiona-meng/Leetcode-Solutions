# 242. Valid Anagram

## Description

Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

Example 1:

Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"

Output: true

Example 2:

Input: s = "rat", t = "car"

Output: false

Constraints:

1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 \* 104
s and t consist of lowercase English letters.

## Approach:

First, check if the lengths of `t` and `s` are different. If they are, return false because they cannot be anagrams.
Next, create a dictionary to count the occurrences of each character in `s`.
Then, iterate over each character in `t`, decrementing the corresponding count in the dictionary.
If a character in `t` is not found in the dictionary or its count is zero, return false.
Finally, check if all counts in the dictionary are zero, indicating that `t` is an anagram of `s`. If so, return true.

```python
def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
    if len(s) != len(t):
        return False
    dic = {}
    for i in s:
        if i not in dic:
            dic[i] = 0
        dic[i] += 1
    for i in t:
        if i in dic and dic[i] > 0:
            dic[i] -= 1
        else:
            return False
    for index, value in dic.items():
        if value != 0:
            return False
    return True
```

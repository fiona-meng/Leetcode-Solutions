# 14 Longest Common Prefix

## Description

Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

Example 1:

Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"
Example 2:

Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.

Constraints:

1 <= strs.length <= 200
0 <= strs[i].length <= 200
strs[i] consists of only lowercase English letters if it is non-empty.

Approach:

To find the longest common prefix among an array of strings, begin by identifying the shortest string in the list, as the longest possible prefix cannot exceed its length.

Starting with the first character of this shortest string, compare it with the corresponding character in all other strings.

If all strings share this character at the same position, proceed to the next character.

Continue this process until a mismatch is found or the end of the shortest string is reached.

The common characters up to this point form the longest common prefix. If no common prefix exists, return an empty string.

```python
def longestCommonPrefix(self, strs: List[str]) -> str:
  length = []
  for s in strs:
      length.append(len(s))
  min_val = min(length)
  min_index = length.index(min_val)
  min_element = strs[min_index]
  for i in range(len(min_element)):
      char = min_element[i]
      for j in range(len(strs)):
          if strs[j][i] != char:
              return min_element[:i]
  return min_element
```

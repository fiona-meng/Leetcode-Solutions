# 35 Search Insert Position

## Description

Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2
Output: 1
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 7
Output: 4

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 104
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
nums contains distinct values sorted in ascending order.
-104 <= target <= 104

## Approach: Binary Search

This problem is similar to the binary search problem. However, instead of returning `-1` when the target value is not found in the array, we return the index where the target would be inserted to maintain the sorted order. In our implementation, this index is represented by the `left` pointer at the end of the search process.

```python
def searchInsert(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while left <= right:
            mid = left +(right - left) // 2
            if nums[mid] == target:
                return mid
            elif nums[mid] > target:
                right = mid - 1
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        return left
```

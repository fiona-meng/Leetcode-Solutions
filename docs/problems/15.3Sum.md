# 15 3Sum

## Description

Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
Explanation:
nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0.
nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[4] = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0.
nums[0] + nums[3] + nums[4] = (-1) + 2 + (-1) = 0.
The distinct triplets are [-1,0,1] and [-1,-1,2].
Notice that the order of the output and the order of the triplets does not matter.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1,1]
Output: []
Explanation: The only possible triplet does not sum up to 0.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [0,0,0]
Output: [[0,0,0]]
Explanation: The only possible triplet sums up to 0.

Constraints:

3 <= nums.length <= 3000
-105 <= nums[i] <= 105

Approach:

In this problem, we need to find three numbers in the array whose sum is zero, similar to the two-sum problem. The task is to identify triplets (n1, n2, n3) such that `n1 + n2 + n3 = 0`. We can rearrange this equation to `n1 = -n2 - n3`, which allows us to treat `n1` as a target value. Our goal is to find two numbers, `n2` and `n3`, that sum up to `-n1`.

To ensure that we do not include duplicate triplets in our solution, we can utilize a set to store the results. This will automatically handle duplicates by only keeping unique triplets.

```python
def threeSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
    nums.sort()
    n = len(nums)
    res = set()
    for i in range(n - 2):
        if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i - 1]:
            continue
        target = -nums[i]
        seen = set()
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            complement = target - nums[j]
            if complement in seen:
                res.add((nums[i], complement, nums[j]))
            seen.add(nums[j])
    return [list(i) for i in res]
```

# 34 Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array

## Description

Given an array of integers nums sorted in non-decreasing order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.

If target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8
Output: [3,4]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 6
Output: [-1,-1]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [], target = 0
Output: [-1,-1]

Constraints:

0 <= nums.length <= 105
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
nums is a non-decreasing array.
-109 <= target <= 109

## Approach: Brute Force

## Approach: Brute Force

Iterate through the array to find the first and last occurrence of the target value. Record the index of the first appearance and continue until the last appearance is found. This approach has a time complexity of `O(n)`.

## Approach: Optimal Solution Using Binary Search

Perform a binary search to locate the target value. Once found, expand outwards from the found index to determine the first and last positions of the target element in the array.

```python
def searchRange(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
  left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
  while left <= right:
      mid = left + (right - left) // 2
      if nums[mid] == target:
          l, r = mid - 1, mid + 1
          while l >= 0:
              if nums[l] != target:
                  break
              l -= 1
          while r < len(nums):
              if nums[r] != target:
                  break
              r += 1
          return [l + 1, r - 1]
      elif nums[mid] > target:
          right = mid - 1
      else:
          left = mid + 1
  return [-1, -1]
```

### Time Complexity

- Time Complexity: O(logn)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

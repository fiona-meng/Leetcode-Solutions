# 53 Maximum Subarray

[Problem: 53 Maximum Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray)

## Description

Given an integer array nums, find the subarray with the largest sum, and return its sum.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: The subarray [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum 6.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation: The subarray [1] has the largest sum 1.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [5,4,-1,7,8]
Output: 23
Explanation: The subarray [5,4,-1,7,8] has the largest sum 23.

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104

Follow up: If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.

## Approach 1: Brute Force

### Intuition

Iterate twice to find every possible subarray and record current maximum subarray

```python
def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    n = len(nums)
    result = float('-inf')
    for i in range(n):
        curr = 0
        for j in range(i, n):
            curr += nums[j]
            result = max(result, curr)
    return result
```

### Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: `O(n^2)`
- Spcae Complexity: `O(1)`

## Approach 2: Kadane's Algorithm

### Intuition

The idea is to iterate through the array while maintaining a running sum of the current subarray. If the running sum becomes negative, it is reset to zero, as any negative sum would decrease the sum of a future subarray. The maximum sum encountered during the iteration is the result.

```python
def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    result = float('-inf')
    curr_max = 0
    for n in nums:
        curr_max += n
        result = max(result, curr_max)
        if curr_max < 0:
            curr_max = 0
    return result
```

### Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: `O(n)`
- Space Complexity: `O(1)`

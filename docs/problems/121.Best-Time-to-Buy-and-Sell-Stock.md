# 121 Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

[Problem 121: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock)

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
Example 2:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

Constraints:

1 <= prices.length <= 105
0 <= prices[i] <= 104

## Approach 1: Brute Force

### Intuition

The simplest way to solve this problem is by iterating all the possible combination and find which largest profit.

```python
def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
  n = len(prices)
  result = 0
  for i in range(n):
      for j in range(i + 1, n):
          diff = prices[j] - prices[i]
          result = max(result, diff)
  return result
```

## Approach 2: Kadane's Algorithm

To solve this problem using a variation of Kadane's Algorithm, we first define `diff[i]` as the difference between consecutive days' prices, specifically `diff[i] = prices[i] - prices[i - 1]`. We then initialize a variable `curr` to keep track of the current sum of these differences. As we iterate through the price differences, if `curr` becomes negative, we reset it to zero. This reset is crucial because a negative `curr` would decrease the potential profit from future transactions. By maintaining the maximum value of `curr`, we can determine the maximum profit possible.

```python
def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
    result = 0
    curr = 0
    n = len(prices)
    for i in range(1, n):
        diff = prices[i] - prices[i - 1]
        curr += diff
        result = max(result, curr)
        if curr < 0:
            curr = 0
    return result
```

# 152 Maximym Product Subarray

## Description

Given an integer array nums, find a subarray that has the largest product, and return the product.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,3,-2,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-2,0,-1]
Output: 0
Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 2 \* 104
-10 <= nums[i] <= 10
The product of any subarray of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

## Approach 1: Brute Force

Simplipy use two for loop to iterate all the possible combinations

```python
def maxProduct(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    result = float('-inf')
    n = len(nums)
    for i in range(n):
        curr = nums[i]
        result = max(result, curr)
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            curr *= nums[j]
            result = max(result, curr)
    return result
```

### Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: `O(n^2)`
- Space Complexity: `O(1)`

## Approach 2: kadane's algorithm

### How it works (Find Maximum Subarray)

Initialization:

max_so_far: Stores the maximum sum found so far (initialized to the smallest possible integer value).

current_max: Stores the maximum sum ending at the current position.

Iteration:
For each element in the array:
Add the current element to current_max.
If current_max is greater than max_so_far, update max_so_far.
If current_max becomes negative, reset it to 0, as a negative sum will only decrease the potential maximum sum.

Result:
max_so_far will hold the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray

To find Maximum Product Subarray, its similar to the Maximum subarray, but need to traverse twice, one from left to right and
from right to left.

Why traverse twice?

For example: `[-2, 2, 3]`
If we traverse from left to right, then the maximum will always be negative.
However, if we traverse from right to left, then the maximum will be `6`.

```python
def maxProduct(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    left, right = float('-inf'), float('-inf')
    n = len(nums)
    curr = 1
    for n in nums:
        curr *= n
        left = max(left, curr)
        if curr == 0:
            curr = 1
    curr = 1
    for i in range(len(nums) - 1, -1, -1):
        curr *= nums[i]
        right = max(right, curr)
        if curr == 0:
            curr = 1
    return max(left, right)
```
